\begin{frame}{Next Steps}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item An orbit analysis will be performed to determine the minimum number of satellites required for different types of orbits
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item A trade-off analysis will be performed to evaluate the complexity of each satellite and the constellation versus the operational orbit of the system
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item The proposed payload will also be developed for a possible future implementation and deployment in one of the research group's upcoming missions. A mission composed of multiple satellites will also be presented and proposed
        \vspace{0.1cm}
        \item The publication of at least one paper about this work is also planned
    \end{itemize}
