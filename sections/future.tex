\begin{frame}{Next Steps}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item An orbit analysis will be added to determine the number of objects required for different types of orbits. As well as the minimum number of satellites required to achieve a certain accuracy considering a receiver being operated by a user of the system
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item We also plan to develop the design of the proposed payload for a possible future implementation and deployment in one of the research group's future missions. To effectively test the proposed system and developed payload, a mission composed of multiple satellites will also be presented and proposed
        \vspace{0.2cm}
        \item The publication of at least one paper about the work is also planned
